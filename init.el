;;; init.el --- Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:
;; This is the initial loader for the code found in README.org
;; It sets up org mode and babel, as well as some custom variables
;; and faces.  These variables and faces were added automatically by
;; packages, and are not meant to be directly edited.
;; It then loads the code in README.org

;;; Code:
;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
